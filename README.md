Project Homeigo - https://superb-alfajores-2745c6.netlify.app/

üèÅ Goals:

In our final project, "Project Homeigo", we worked on building a real estate market place, building the database, backend and frontend ourselves. We wanted to implement all the techstack we have learnt during our time with Technigo and set out to incorporate html, CSS, React, Redux, MongoDB, POSTMAN, Google Cloud and Figma.

We started out by figuring out the different parts of the project in our Figma file and utilized a common Trello. We started building the search function and built out the project from there. We always wanted to have a nice design in mind and we worked a lot on the design of our functions. We wanted a sleek feel of the end product.

The goal for these three week was to have a finished realtor homepage thats fetches the property objects from our database and displays them in a nice fashion in the final product. We wanted to use a hamburger menu, for it to be responsive and have a designed and functioning startpage.

Overall this project went well. We worked together well and used pull requests and reviews when merging to the master branch in Github. This was a new way to work for us and it worked out great. It was interesting to work with the filtering in the search function and we learn't a lot from it. It was also a good project for us to feel more at home in building both backend, frontend and for the first time, build our own database.

We are very pleased with the outcome and looking forward to using the skills and knowledge we gained from this project in future endeavors.

Must-have requirements:

‚úÖ Create a databas with objects containing: Apartments, Houses & Vacation Homes.

‚úÖ Search function for - square feet, price range, rooms. 

‚úÖ Hamburger menu.

‚úÖ Inspiring startpage.

‚úÖ Footer - SOME-links, logo and other links. 

üöß The problem:

We started by going through the design and sketching the different components out along with the design, deciding on how to structure the webpage. We used a mob-programming approach, starting off by building the entire structure for the backend before moving on to the frontend, and lastly working on the design features.

If we had more time, we would have implemented an authenticator, where the user could sign in and save properties they were interested in.

üíª Tech stack:
